/// A store represents the runtime that powers the application. It is the object that you will pass
/// around to views that need to interact with the application.
///
/// You will typically construct a single one of these at the root of your application:
///
/// ```swift
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///   var body: some Scene {
///     WindowGroup {
///       RootView(
///         store: Store(
///           initialState: AppReducer.State(),
///           reducer: AppReducer()
///         )
///       )
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦and then use the ``scope(state:action:)`` method to derive more focused stores that can be
/// passed to subviews.
///
/// ### Scoping
///
/// The most important operation defined on ``Store`` is the ``scope(state:action:)`` method, which
/// allows you to transform a store into one that deals with child state and actions. This is
/// necessary for passing stores to subviews that only care about a small portion of the entire
/// application's domain.
///
/// For example, if an application has a tab view at its root with tabs for activity, search, and
/// profile, then we can model the domain like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct State {
///   var activity: Activity.State
///   var profile: Profile.State
///   var search: Search.State
/// }
///
/// enum Action {
///   case activity(Activity.Action)
///   case profile(Profile.Action)
///   case search(Search.Action)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We can construct a view for each of these domains by applying ``scope(state:action:)`` to a
/// store that holds onto the full app domain in order to transform it into a store for each
/// sub-domain:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppReducer>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     TabView {
///       ActivityView(store: self.store.scope(state: \.activity, action: App.Action.activity))
///         .tabItem { Text("Activity") }
///
///       SearchView(store: self.store.scope(state: \.search, action: App.Action.search))
///         .tabItem { Text("Search") }
///
///       ProfileView(store: self.store.scope(state: \.profile, action: App.Action.profile))
///         .tabItem { Text("Profile") }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Thread safety
///
/// The `Store` class is not thread-safe, and so all interactions with an instance of ``Store``
/// (including all of its scopes and derived ``ViewStore``s) must be done on the same thread the
/// store was created on. Further, if the store is powering a SwiftUI or UIKit view, as is
/// customary, then all interactions must be done on the _main_ thread.
///
/// The reason stores are not thread-safe is due to the fact that when an action is sent to a store,
/// a reducer is run on the current state, and this process cannot be done from multiple threads.
/// It is possible to make this process thread-safe by introducing locks or queues, but this
/// introduces new complications:
///
///   * If done simply with `DispatchQueue.main.async` you will incur a thread hop even when you are
///     already on the main thread. This can lead to unexpected behavior in UIKit and SwiftUI, where
///     sometimes you are required to do work synchronously, such as in animation blocks.
///
///   * It is possible to create a scheduler that performs its work immediately when on the main
///     thread and otherwise uses `DispatchQueue.main.async` (_e.g._, see Combine Schedulers'
///     [UIScheduler][uischeduler]).
///
/// This introduces a lot more complexity, and should probably not be adopted without having a very
/// good reason.
///
/// This is why we require all actions be sent from the same thread. This requirement is in the same
/// spirit of how `URLSession` and other Apple APIs are designed. Those APIs tend to deliver their
/// outputs on whatever thread is most convenient for them, and then it is your responsibility to
/// dispatch back to the main queue if that's what you need. The Composable Architecture makes you
/// responsible for making sure to send actions on the main thread. If you are using an effect that
/// may deliver its output on a non-main thread, you must explicitly perform `.receive(on:)` in
/// order to force it back on the main thread.
///
/// This approach makes the fewest number of assumptions about how effects are created and
/// transformed, and prevents unnecessary thread hops and re-dispatching. It also provides some
/// testing benefits. If your effects are not responsible for their own scheduling, then in tests
/// all of the effects would run synchronously and immediately. You would not be able to test how
/// multiple in-flight effects interleave with each other and affect the state of your application.
/// However, by leaving scheduling out of the ``Store`` we get to test these aspects of our effects
/// if we so desire, or we can ignore if we prefer. We have that flexibility.
///
/// [uischeduler]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/combine-schedulers/blob/main/Sources/CombineSchedulers/UIScheduler.swift
///
/// #### Thread safety checks
///
/// The store performs some basic thread safety checks in order to help catch mistakes. Stores
/// constructed via the initializer ``init(initialState:reducer:prepareDependencies:)`` are assumed
/// to run only on the main thread, and so a check is executed immediately to make sure that is the
/// case. Further, all actions sent to the store and all scopes (see ``scope(state:action:)``) of
/// the store are also checked to make sure that work is performed on the main thread.

    ///     state: \.login,
    ///     action: AppAction.login

    /// Scoping in this fashion allows you to better modularize your application. In this case,

    ///
    /// Scoping also gives a view the opportunity to focus on just the state and actions it cares
    /// about, even if its feature domain is larger.
    ///
    /// For example, the above login domain could model a two screen login flow: a login form followed
    /// by a two-factor authentication screen. The second screen's domain might be nested in the

    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct LoginState: Equatable {
    ///   var email = ""
    ///   var password = ""
    ///   var twoFactorAuth: TwoFactorAuthState?
    /// }
    ///
    /// enum LoginAction: Equatable {
    ///   case emailChanged(String)
    ///   case loginButtonTapped
    ///   case loginResponse(Result<TwoFactorAuthState, LoginError>)
    ///   case passwordChanged(String)
    ///   case twoFactorAuth(TwoFactorAuthAction)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The login view holds onto a store of this domain:
    /// ```swift
    /// struct LoginView: View {
    ///   let store: Store<LoginState, LoginAction>
    ///
    ///   var body: some View { ... }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If its body were to use a view store of the same domain, this would introduce a number of
    /// problems:
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to read from `twoFactorAuth` state. This state is only intended
    ///   to be read from the two-factor auth screen.
    ///
    /// * Even worse, changes to `twoFactorAuth` state would now cause SwiftUI to recompute
    ///   `LoginView`'s body unnecessarily.
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to send `twoFactorAuth` actions. These actions are only
    ///   intended to be sent from the two-factor auth screen (and reducer).
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to send non user-facing login actions, like `loginResponse`.
    ///   These actions are only intended to be used in the login reducer to feed the results of
    ///   effects back into the store.
    ///
    /// To avoid these issues, one can introduce a view-specific domain that slices off the subset of
    /// state and actions that a view cares about:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// extension LoginView {
    ///   struct State: Equatable {
    ///     var email: String
    ///     var password: String
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   enum Action: Equatable {
    ///     case emailChanged(String)
    ///     case loginButtonTapped
    ///     case passwordChanged(String)
    ///   }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// One can also introduce a couple helpers that transform feature state into view state and
    /// transform view actions into feature actions.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// extension LoginState {
    ///   var view: LoginView.State {
    ///     .init(email: self.email, password: self.password)
    ///   }
    /// }
    ///
    /// extension LoginView.Action {
    ///   var feature: LoginAction {
    ///     switch self {
    ///     case let .emailChanged(email)
    ///       return .emailChanged(email)
    ///     case .loginButtonTapped:
    ///       return .loginButtonTapped
    ///     case let .passwordChanged(password)
    ///       return .passwordChanged(password)
    ///     }
    ///   }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// With these helpers defined, `LoginView` can now scope its store's feature domain into its view

    ///    WithViewStore(
